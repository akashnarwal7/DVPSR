# Dynamic Vehicle Routing with Stochastic Requests



## Description
The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Requests (DVRPSR) is a prototypical problem in transportation logistics. The DVRPSR calls for an initial route plan and an online scheduling policy to route dynamically and in real-time a fleet of vehicles, in such a way that the number of customer requests accepted and served is maximized, and all vehicles return to the depot before a given deadline.

This repository contains the source code and datasets to allow the replication of the results from the paper:

The code implements the following **scheduling policies** for the DVRPSR:
* **Greedy policy**: Accepts dynamic requests in a greedy fashion, and update planned routes either by cheapest insertion or by complete reoptimization.
* **PFA policy**: Scheduling policy based on policy function approximation.
* **Rollout policy**: Applies the rollout algorithm with either the Greedy or the PFA policy as the base policy.
* **Potential-based policy**: Accepts dynamic requests as long as the immediate reward offsets the estimated decrease in the reward-to-go, which is computed by solving multiple-knapsack models.\
**Currently the best-performing online policy for the DVRPSR.**
* **Simplified potential-based policy**: Similar to the potential-based policy, but the reward-to-go is approximated by single-knapsack models.

In addition, code for the following **offline planners** is also provided:
* **Myopic planner**: Offline route planner that solves approximately a duration-constrained VRP by a column generation-based heuristic.
* **Potential-based planner**: Offline route planner that evaluates the expected reward-to-go of planned routes by single-knapsack models.\
**Currently the best performing offline planner for the DVRPSR.**

## Dependencies
The implementation requires:
* The [boost](https://www.boost.org) C++ libraries, which are installed by default in most Linux environments.
* The [CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio), which is free for academic use. CPLEX is used **(i)** for solving the multiple-knapsack models, **(ii)** within the column generation procedure for generating offline route plans, and **(iii)** within a branch-and-cut Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm for reoptimizing planned routes.

## Building and Running
A `Makefile` is provided for reference only. This should be adapted to match the specific host requirements, including `CPLEX` header files and libraries.

The code compiles into a single executable `dvrpsr`. The app allows several command line options:

```

For example, to simulate the potential-based policy (PbP) on the Vienna network with ~0.4 requests per minute, uniformly distributed and time-invariant (UTI) request distribution and 5 vehicles under the provided trajectory and (potential-based) offline plan:
```
$ ./dvrpsr 21 V-0.4-UTI-5-50 ../reqs/V-0.4-UTI.1.req ../offline_plans/V-0.4-UTI-5.pb.op

```
After around 4 minutes (depending on the hardware) the simulation finishes and the app outputs summary statistics:
```
[...]

Simulation results:

total duration of static and accepted dynamic requests: 1715.48
(min % over total service duration: 0.571825)
avg decision time: 0.872298 s
max decision time: 2.067 s
```
Note: the simulation takes considerably longer in larger instances. In the largest instance of the dataset (V-1.5-UTI-20), policy PbP (H=50) takes up to 150 seconds **per request** (depending on hardware). Other policies (e.g., rollout policies with H=25 or higher) are not suitable for very large instances.
